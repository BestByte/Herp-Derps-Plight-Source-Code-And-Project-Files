# Herp Derp's Plight

Developed using the Unity Engine, 'Herp Derp's Plight' is a 2D, Roguelike card battling game reminiscent of titles like 'Dungeons And Dragons', 'Slay The Spire' and 'Divinity 2: Original Sin'. The player controls a team a characters, and must successfully navigate a dangerous dungeon, overrun with undead, goblins, and all manner of deplorable beings. 
This project is currently my main focus, and due for early access in March 2021.

Customize your characters race, talents, starting deck, weapons, appearance and more. Who will you be? A savage orc berserker? A human paladin ? A satyr shaman? An undead wizard? The choice is yours...

##### Emergent narative and character development
